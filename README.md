# Infrastructure

Hello, this repository is where we keep our configuration files and other aspects regarding our VPS management and usage.

## Note

We try to be as transparent as possible, however, there are some things that we can't upload like private keys and other sensitive information since that would compromise the security of our servers.

* We use `linuxserver/swag` (nginx) as reverse proxy and to renew our SSL certificates.
