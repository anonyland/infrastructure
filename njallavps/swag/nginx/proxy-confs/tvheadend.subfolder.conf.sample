## Version 2022/10/01
# Before activating this config you need to do two things:
# - enable a setting in the tvheadend web interface 
# - change your RUN_OPTS for tvheadend. 
#
# You need to enable the setting "PROXY protocol & X-Forwarded For"
# in the tvheadend web interface. This setting can be found in 
# "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Base" in the "HTTP Server Settings" Group. 
# You need to set the View level to Expert to see it. Once activated, you may need to 
# restart your tvheadend container. When testing this config, please be reminded 
# that the tvheadend docker can take a very long time to start (>10mins). 
# 
# For the subfolder to work you also need to edit your tvheadend docker compose / cli config 
# and set http_root in RUN_OPTS to tvheadend, e.g. in docker compose:
# - RUN_OPTS= --http_root /tvheadend

location /tvheadend {
    return 301 $scheme://$host/tvheadend/;
}

location /tvheadend/ {
    # enable the next two lines for http auth
    #auth_basic "Restricted";
    #auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd;

    # enable for ldap auth (requires ldap-server.conf in the server block)
    #include /config/nginx/ldap-location.conf;

    # enable for Authelia (requires authelia-server.conf in the server block)
    #include /config/nginx/authelia-location.conf;
    include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
    include /config/nginx/resolver.conf;

    set $upstream_app tvheadend;
    set $upstream_port 9981;
    set $upstream_proto http;
    proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port;
}
