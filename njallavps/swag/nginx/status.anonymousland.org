# make sure that your dns has a cname set for element
# if element is running in bridge mode and the container is named "element", the below config should work as is
# if not, replace the line "set $upstream_app element;" with "set $upstream_app <containername>;"
# or "set $upstream_app <HOSTIP>;" for host mode, HOSTIP being the IP address of element
